# Key Aspects That Show Our System Succeeded

## 1. Qualitative: What's Happening in Participants' Heads

- **They understand things better** - When the chatbot explains a topic, it clicks. They have "aha!" moments where concepts make sense.

- **They feel less overwhelmed** - Instead of being confused by all the topics, they see what's important and feel like they can actually study this.

- **They feel more confident** - They're less anxious about exams because they know what to focus on and understand the material better.

- **They're curious and engaged** - They want to ask follow-up questions and explore more. It feels like talking to a smart friend, not reading a textbook.

- **They remember things better** - Because topics are explained in context and connected to other topics, they actually remember what they learned.

- **They feel prepared** - After using the system, they feel ready to answer questions about the topics they covered.

## 2. Quantitative: How This Shows Up in the Interaction

- **They ask lots of questions** - Successful users ask 5-10+ questions per session. They're actively engaging with the chatbot.

- **They ask follow-up questions** - Instead of just asking one question and leaving, they ask things like "can you explain more about that?" or "how does this connect to X?" This shows they're actually learning.

- **They explore multiple topics** - They don't just ask about one topic. They explore 3-5+ different topics in a session, showing they're using the system to study broadly.

- **They use the concept map** - Most successful users (70%+) click to view the concept map and spend time looking at how topics connect.

- **They request practice questions** - About 30%+ of users ask for practice questions, showing they want to test their understanding.

- **They come back to sessions** - Users return to their saved sessions 2+ times, showing the system is useful for ongoing study.

- **They spend time studying** - Successful sessions last 15-30+ minutes. Users aren't just clicking around - they're actually studying.

- **They ask "why" questions** - They ask why topics were ranked certain ways (25%+ of sessions), showing they're thinking critically about the material.

- **They complete progressive teaching** - When the chatbot teaches a topic step-by-step, 60%+ of users continue through all the steps instead of stopping early.

- **They explore connections** - About 20%+ of users ask "how are X and Y related?" showing they're building a mental map of the material.

## What This Means

If participants are understanding better, feeling confident, and staying engaged (qualitative), we'll see it in their behavior: lots of questions, exploring multiple topics, coming back to study more, and using all the features (quantitative).

The system is working if users are actually learning and feeling prepared, not just clicking through the interface.
